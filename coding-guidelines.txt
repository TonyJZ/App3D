### Developer coding guidelines:

## General
* Please make sure the main development branch (`develop`) always works
* Only push completed or working features to `develop`
* If partially finished codes or codes not related to the `develop` branch needs to be shared, create a separate branch
* Follow coding guidelines in `eslintrc.js`
* Remove all `console.log` from `develop` branch.
* Please use English in comments and commit messages etc.
* Remove all commented-out code, except for code blocks that might become relevent in the future, or which are left for instructional purposes
* Run eslint and fix all issues before merging

## Naming conventions
* Class names are `ClassName`
* Function names are `functionName`
* Variables and constants are `variables` and `constants`. Excpet for constants in `Constant.js` file which are `CONSTANT`
* Directory names are `directoryName`
* File names are `fileName.js` if non class javascript file, `FileName.js` if Javascript class file, `file-name.txt` for non javascript files (except for specialized files) 
* Branch names are `branch-name`.

## git workflow
* Pull latest `develop` before developing, 
* Branch, give branch a meaningfull name based on the feature, bug being worked on
* Once development is complete, fetch `develop` again and rebase on top of `develop`.
